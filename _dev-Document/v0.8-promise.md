## Project - KoryenAlbCraft: Optimizing Your Albion Online Economy

This document outlines the vision and core functionality of **KoryenAlbCraft**, an innovative tool designed to transform how players engage with the Albion Online in-game economy. Our goal is to make profit-making in Albion Online easier, faster, and more accessible for everyone.

### Part 1: How KoryenAlbCraft Solves a Problem (For Non-Technical Users)

**The Problem: Manual Profit Calculation in Albion Online is a Nightmare**
Imagine you want to make money in Albion Online by crafting or trading items. Currently, many players, including our project creator, rely on **manual methods, like complex Excel spreadsheets**, to calculate whether a specific crafting recipe or trade route will be profitable. This involves:

-   **Hours of manual data collection**: Checking the prices of raw materials and finished products in different cities, often running around the game world to gather the latest numbers.
-   **Outdated information**: Market prices in Albion Online change constantly. By the time you've manually checked all the prices and updated your spreadsheet, the information is often old, leading to missed opportunities or even losses.
-   **Complexity**: The formulas for calculating profit, including taxes and material return rates, can be very complicated to manage manually.

This manual process is **time-consuming, prone to errors, and prevents players from reacting quickly** to profitable opportunities in the dynamic Albion Online market. Our project creator described this manual process as something that "makes me go crazy".

**KoryenAlbCraft: Your Automated Profit Navigator**
KoryenAlbCraft is envisioned as a **powerful software tool that solves this exact problem** by automating the entire profit calculation process. Instead of spending hours on manual checks, the tool will provide you with **real-time, accurate profit insights** at your fingertips.

**How it Works (The Simple Version):**

1.  **Intelligent Data Collection**: KoryenAlbCraft doesn't send you into the game to check prices manually. Instead, it connects to a specialized, community-driven "Albion Online Data Project". This project has a network of players who voluntarily share real-time market data directly from the game's servers, ensuring the prices are always up-to-date. This means **KoryenAlbCraft receives market prices automatically**, without you having to lift a finger.
2.  **The "Brain" of the Operation**: Once KoryenAlbCraft has the latest prices for all items and locations, its "brain" (our sophisticated backend logic) kicks in. It takes the crafting recipes and trading routes you're interested in and **applies complex profit formulas** (like those the creator used in Excel). These calculations factor in everything: the cost of raw materials, the selling price of the finished item, in-game taxes, and even the "return rate" of materials during crafting.
3.  **Instant Profit Assessment**: The challenge of handling a massive number of data requests from the game's servers (which can cause errors in manual spreadsheets) is overcome by KoryenAlbCraft's design. It will be built to **efficiently request and consolidate large amounts of data at once**, ensuring smooth and reliable operation.

The ultimate goal for KoryenAlbCraft (moving towards its broader public release, akin to **v1** of the project) is to become a "software to help calculate" for various items and situations in Albion Online. It aims to become a **"very good" tool for earning money** and has the potential to "shake the Albion market" by quickly identifying profitable opportunities.

### How the Tool Gives You the Outcome or Result

KoryenAlbCraft is designed to deliver **clear, actionable insights** that directly empower your economic decisions in Albion Online.

**Key Outcomes You'll Receive:**

-   **Direct Profit Calculations**: The tool will show you **exactly how much profit you can make**, either in raw silver numbers or as a clear percentage, for any crafting or trading activity you're considering. This is the immediate answer to "Is this profitable?".
    -   For example, it could tell you: "Crafting a Tier 4 Sword in Martlock yields a **48% profit** if materials are bought from Bridgewatch" or "Flipping this item from Lymhurst to the Black Market earns you **11,700 Silver**".
-   **Real-time Decision Support**: Instead of outdated numbers, you'll see prices that are **updated almost in real-time** (within minutes). This speed allows you to seize opportunities before the market shifts.
-   **Optimized Strategies**: The tool will help you identify the **most profitable items to craft**, the **best cities to trade between**, and even the **optimal timing** for buying and selling. This automates the time-consuming analysis the creator currently does manually.
-   **Intuitive Presentation**: While the initial Minimal Viable Product (MVP, v0.1) focuses on core functionality like saving notes via AI to Google Drive, the full vision for KoryenAlbCraft (approaching **v0.8** and then **v1**) would involve a user-friendly interface that clearly displays these profit opportunities. This could look like a dynamic table or list, similar to how current third-party Albion Online tools show item prices and statistics. For instance, a feature like a "Market Flipper" could instantly highlight profitable flip opportunities across all cities, including the Black Market.
-   **Increased Efficiency and Less Effort**: The core benefit is **saving you significant time and effort**. What used to take "over an hour" to update manually will become an automated process, allowing you to focus on playing the game rather than crunching numbers.

In essence, KoryenAlbCraft aims to be your **personal economic advisor** in Albion Online, distilling vast amounts of market data into clear, concise, and actionable profit opportunities, empowering you to make money effectively and efficiently within the game.
