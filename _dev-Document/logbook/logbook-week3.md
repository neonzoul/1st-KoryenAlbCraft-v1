### Key Story : Complete Blueprint within 3 hours

```
As the morning filters through here in Songkhla, Start at 8AM after exercise and take some energy from Sun.
The realuty of today's progress in sinking in. This morning bagan with a sudden pivot.
.
A Youtube stream last night from #Bouanglive633 crystallized a problem that felt more immidiate, a pain point I was instantly more passionate and enjoy about solving.
.
I knew it was the absolute last chance to change course; with Week 3 marking the start of pure execution, the window for planning was closing fast. It was now or never.

This decision meant compressing two weeks of foundational planning for the new project, KoryenAlbCraft,
into a sigle, intense session to keep the timeline intact. The workflow was a perfect symphony of human direction and AI execution.
.
First, I fed all the high-level context--the new pain point, architectural notes from past projects, the core vision--into the Notebook LLM, which acted as my "Solutions Achitect," generating the complete project blueprint.

Then, I handed that blueprint to GitHub Copilot. Acting as the "Developer," it flawlessly executed the plan, scaffolding the entire project skeleton in minutes.
.
This hyper-efficiant process allowed me to not only complete the two weeks of planning but also finish today's original Day 1 tasks.
.
the final, ceremonaial commit, "hello, world", was the declaration that the gambit paid off.
" The project is born, and we are perdectly on schedule.
